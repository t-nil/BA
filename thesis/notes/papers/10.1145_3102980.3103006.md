## 1-sentence takeaway
- linear type system + lifetime tracking in rust: three examples of improved security/reliability

## Why I care / where it fits
- Use: ch01-intro ch02-motivation (ch04-motivation)

## Contributions / claims
- [C] many low-level software solutions still written in C (ch01-intro)
- [C] CVEs in linux kernel (ch01-intro)

## Definitions / taxonomy
- [D] linear type system
- lifetime tracking

## Method / setup (only what matters)
- TODO

## Results I might cite
- (p. ?) TODO
- (Fig. ?, p. ?) TODO

## Quotables / near-quotables (verbatim candidates)
- [Q] (p. ?, context) “...”
  Use: chX-...

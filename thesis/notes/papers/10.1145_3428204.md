# {{CITEKEY}} — How do programmers use unsafe rust?

## 1-sentence takeaway
- empiric study about use of unsafe rust in large projects
- talks about limits of safe rust and effects of unsafe rust on language guarantees (in introduction)

## Why I care / where it fits
- Use: chX-... / section ...
- TODO

## Contributions / claims
- A classification of the motivations for using unsafe code.
- An empirical study of how unsafe code is used in practice.
- A discussion of the implications for reasoning about Rust code (in code reviews or during
  verification).
- Our reusable open-source infrastructure and the analysed data is available online [Qrates
  Team 2020].
